## About Me

I am an undergraduate enrolled in the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC) Computer Science Degree Program with a focus in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. I have full stack experience in languages such as Python, C++, as well as HTML/CSS and JavaScript. I have worked in several industry and academic development teams throughout my career practicing Agile methodologies.

I am also a Cyber Scholar for the Center For Women in Technology (CWIT) at UMBC. CWIT is an organization that enables success for all women and other underrepresented groups in technology fields by cultivating a supportive and diverse community in computing and engineering at UMBC. I have spent part of my time at UMBC participating in CWIT discussions, events, as well as leading, planning, and executing lessons for incoming male-identifying CWIT members, teaching about topics surrounding diversity, equity, and inclusion in both school and the workplace.

## Previous Projects

âœˆ ***Northrop Grumman 2023 Internship:***
Developed C++ message classes enabling communication between a multitude of systems on the EA-18G
Growler aircraft, facilitating the exchange of diverse message types. Collaborated closely with the program
team and senior engineers in conducting comprehensive code reviews, gaining invaluable exposure to
efficient coding methodologies and Agile development practices.

ðŸŽµ [***Lyridact:***](https://github.com/PeteePanda/CMSC447)
A web-based game where lyrics to a popular song with varying amounts of words redacted are given to a player, who then tries to guess word by word what the title of the song is. The user may fill in the lyrics with their guesses, and can also solve the puzzle by completing all the lyrics in the song. There are 3 levels and they are updated everyday. I primarily worked on the front-end and assisted on the back-end for this project. Written in HTML/CSS/JS and Python.

âœˆ ***Northrop Grumman 2022 Internship:***
Utilized C++ and Python for optimizing Synthetic Aperture Radar simulations to run in a Unix
environment. Timing analysis showed a 25% increase in product efficiency. Practiced Agile development
in a team environment using Atlassian products such as BitBucket, Confluence, and JIRA to upgrade and
optimize existing software for practical use.


## Current Projects and Applications

ðŸŽµ ***Lyridact (Global):*** Rewriting the "Lyridact" project mentioned above to bring the game to the general public. Planning on using a more cohesive API for the songs and lyrics as well as enabling global leaderboards.

ðŸŒŽ ***LivingWanderLust Travels Website***: Currently crafting an engaging travel agency website, while also engaging in discussions with the client regarding functionality and design. I am using Figma as a design tool and am simultaneously diving into React.js, elevating the site's functionality and interactivity.

ðŸ§  ***Outfit Designer***: Personal machine learning project involving the training of a convolutional neural network (CNN) for image processing clothing and recurrent neural network (RNN) or transformer models for generating outfit combinations.
