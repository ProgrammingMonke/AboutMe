## About Me

I am an undergraduate enrolled in the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC) Computer Science Degree Program with a focus in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. I have full stack experience in languages such as Python, C++, as well as HTML/CSS and JavaScript. I have worked in several industry and academic development teams throughout my career practicing Agile methodologies.

I am also a Cyber Scholar for the Center For Women in Technology (CWIT) at UMBC. CWIT is an organization that enables success for all women and other underrepresented groups in technology fields by cultivating a supportive and diverse community in computing and engineering at UMBC. I have spent part of my time at UMBC participating in CWIT discussions, events, as well as leading, planning, and executing lessons for incoming male-identifying CWIT members, teaching about topics surrounding diversity, equity, and inclusion in both school and the workplace.
